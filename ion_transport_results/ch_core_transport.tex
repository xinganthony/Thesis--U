\chapter{Results: Ion Thermal Transport in MST's PPCD plasmas}\label{ch:results}



This chapter is the core of this thesis, as it describes the main body of results and discoveries made during this modeling effort. Overall, the result is this transport model based on classical effects can adequately describe the temperature evolution in the core, but needs an extra \textit{ad hoc} heating term localized in the edge to account for the ion temperatures in the edge. This chapter will get to this result in three steps. First is a discussion of the neutral dynamics, including the charge exchange and impact ionization rates in PPCD plasmas, as well as some unintuitive effects of adding an \textit{ad hoc} heating term in the edge have on the neutral dynamics in the core. This is followed by a discussion of the inward pinch needed to account for density evolution, how it is correlated with the \ecb flux, its context as part of the net radial flow and how this pinch effect the thermal transport. Finally, I discuss the comparison between model and data, with with and without \textit{ad hoc} term in the edge, explore the profile shape of this term, and compare it with out understanding of anomalous heating. This is a long chapter, let's get started.
