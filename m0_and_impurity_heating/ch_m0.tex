\chapter{Edge impurity ion heating associated with $m = 0$ activity in PPCD}\label{ch:m0}

In addition to the slower time scale ion thermal transport modeling, the particular phenomenon of impurity ion heating in connection with $m = 0$ bursts deserves some attention. Ideally, the m = 0 burst would not occur, and the datasets underlying the previous chapter are selected to avoid "bursty" PPCD shots. However, these $m = 0$ bursts and their heating effects are relatively small perturbations, especially compared with sawteeth events, making them interesting to study. Since they are brief events and the plasma returns to the PPCD quasi-equilibrium quickly, their effects can be more comfortably discussed as perturbations on a (relatively) known state. This section will first go into a brief discussion of the current understanding of $m = 0$ bursts, their characteristics and their broader context in relation to PPCD plasmas. Then I discuss the measurements of impurity carbon heating observed in relation to theses bursts. Finally, I present the results of modeling attempts within the framework of the ion thermal transport model discussed in previous chapters.

\section{Characteristics of $m = 0$ burst activity}
What is now called the $m = 0$ bursts is also referred to as "small dynamo events", especially in work revolving around the thesis of B. Chapman \cite{Chapman1997}. Similar to sawtooth events, the $m = 0$ bursts generate toroidal flux and poloidal current. However, unlike the sawtooth events, they first appear in the edge resonant modes, in particular the $m = 0$ modes (hence it's current name). These $m = 0$ bursts are observed in sawtooth surpressed axis-symmetric plasmas such as PPCD plasmas or the spontaneously occurring Enhanced Confinement (EC) plasmas. Despite it's name, the $m = 0$ burst does excite the $m = 1$ tearing modes as well shortly after the $m = 0$ mode (see figure \ref{fig:m0_time}), merely reversing the order of excitation as compared to sawtooth events. Further, it is not clear that the $m = 0$ bursts can be said to be caused by the destabilization of $m = 0$ modes, or that the $m = 0$ mode are themselves preceded by other instabilities. It is previously found that the frequency of $m = 0$ bursts can be reduced by reversing $E_{\text{tor}}$ at the edge during the PPCD period, thereby help maintain $E_\parallel > 0$\cite{Chapman2001}. Interestingly, the $m = 0$ bursts that persist in occurring after this optimization has been made are largely concentrated in the earlier part of the PPCD period, before edge $E_{\text{tor}}$ reverses (figure \ref{fig:m0_shot_time}).

\end{figure}

The $m = 0$ bursts involve a wide range of $n$ numbers with coherent phase in such a way that it reconstructs to a single larger perturbation at one particular location, akin to the relation between a Dirac delta and it's Fourier transform. A good way to visualize some aspects of the $m = 0$ burst is presented in figure \ref{fig:m0_example}. The top plot is the contour of the model amplitude vs. time and toroidal mode number ($n$), and on the bottom is a contour of the reconstructed $B_{\text{tor}}$ vs time and toroidal angle ($\phi$). The PPCD capacitor banks are engaged starting at 10ms, and the improved confinement achieved in this shot lasts until about 22ms, during which three $m = 0$ bursts are seen. In addition, three sawtooth events can also be seen at ~5.5, 6, and 8ms. The broad $n$ number excitation can be seen as well as the limited toroidal extent of the "main" perturbation. It can also be observed their relatively small amplitude and short duration as compared to sawtooth events. It is interesting to point out that the second burst seems to have energized the core ($n = 6$) mode, but the third burst de-energized it. It is generally the case that the bursts will generally interact with the core mode, but not in an easily generalizable way. Previous studies of $m = 0$ bursts conducted by Piovesean et al.\cite{Piovesan2008} find that the magnetic field measurements can be explained by a simple model, where a poloidal, field-aligned current filament that spontaneously arises, and travels in the toroidal direction for a short time before disappearing. In addition, a broad spectrum of $m = 1$, high $n$ fluctuations are also excited and propagate toroidally.  The effect of individual bursts on transport is small\cite{Piovesan2008}. In the high current PPCD studied in this work, the typical burst results in a $B_{\text{tor}}$ perturbation with toroidal width of $\approx 10\degree$ and travels $\approx 40\degree$. 

The effect of these bursts were characterized previously through fast Thomson Scattering measurements and the electron temperature was observed to decrease during the bursts. Additionally, a 'cold pulse' like feature was observed to travel inwards during, and immediately after, the burst (fig \ref{fig:m0_te_pulse}). This indicates increased electron transport during this period and temperature changes on a observable timescale. Further, it is observed that bursts that occur near the measurement location results in significantly more temperature drop as compared to those away from the measurement location.

\section{Observation of impurity heating associated with the $m = 0$ activities.}

The impurity temperature of C$^{6+}$ temperature are measured using CHERS at 50kHz and ensemble over similar events.
The dynamics being investigated occur at a faster timescale than the equlibration time between majority and impurity ions, and the CHERS measurements should not be interpreted as reflecting that of the majority. It is well known that sawtooth events heat the impurities more than the majority\cite{Magee2011}, and it is expected that the same applies to $m = 0$ burst heating.

Active CHERS measurement of C$^{6+}$ temperature show significant heating due to bursts radially located in the edge. Figure \ref{fig:m0_heating} shows the ensemble time evolution of the heating pulse for the range of measurement locations. The heating is very distinct in the edge locations but drops below regular fluctuation levels by chord 9 ($\rho/a = 0.37$). This is consistent with the expectation for $m = 0$ bursts which are localized at/near the reversal surface, and is similar to heating behavior of edge reconnection events examined by S. Gangadhara\cite{Gangadhara2008}. However, $T_i$ at the radial locations are observed to heat at the same time, and not display the radial delay seen in the $T_e$ measurements. Additionally, the temperature returns to equilibrium with a time scale $\lesssim 0.5ms$, which is significantly shorter than the expected ion confinement time. A comparison with the model's response to a burst-like event is presented in the next section.

\end{figure}


An important observation resulting from the active measurements are high speed at which heating propagates around the machine. As can be seen in figure \ref{fig:m0_no_delay}, when the burst heating measurements are broken down into sub-ensembles separated by distance between the toroidal measurement location and the burst location, no delay is found. The charge exchange data is fitted at 50kHz, implying that any possible delay is smaller than 20$\mu s$. This indicates that the impurity heating is toroidally global. If we assume that the opposite is true, that the burst produces a local heating event located where the burst is located, then the toroidally local deposit of heat would need to travel to the other side of the device. For a very simple estimation of the time involved, the travel times of hypothetical deuterium ions at thermal velocity along equilibrium field line from one location to the direct opposite side of device toroidally are calculated for a range of $\rho$ near the reversal surface. This is presented in figure \ref{fig:heat_travel_time}. The actual thermal conduction time would be significantly longer than this as parallel conduction is slowed by collisions, and impurity thermal velocity is slower than deuterium. The delay of a toroially travelling heat pulse would be slower than 20$\mu s$, meaning that the observed heating is not a result of such a heat pulse, but the energy released through the $m = 0$ bursts travels around the device as EM waves/fluctuations and result in toroidally global (but radially local) impurity heating. The heating mechanism is not clear from this observation alone, however, informed speculation would posit that the $m = 0$ burst excites plasma waves and fluctuations that travel around toridally faster than ions can, and then heats the ions on the other side. Indeed, in Piovesan's prior work, $m = 1$ fluctuations are observed to be excited by $m = 0$ bursts, and propagate toroidally\cite{Piovesan2008}. The particulars of how that fluctuation leads to heating is likely complex and would be up for debate, considering that prior studies concluded that $m = 1$ fluctuations do not lead to heating if there is no accompanying $m = 0$ fluctuation. Mode coupling is likely involved, but there is insufficient evidence from observations made in this study.

The impurity heating associated with sawtooth events are known to be anisotropic, and the potential anisotropy of $m = 0$ induced impurity heating is investigated through passive IDS observations of C$^{4+}$ and C$^{2+}$ temperatures. The density profile of these two carbon charge states have limited radial extent, forming an emission 'shell'. A passive IDS view directly across the shell captures the perpendicular, and in ideal conditions, a view directly tangential to the emission shell at the reversal surface would return the parallel temperature. In reality the passive measurements cannot be directly translated to perpendicular and parallel temperature, although it is sufficient to estimate anisotropy in past studies \cite{Magee2011,Magee2011a}. Two emission shells are measured for anisotropy estimation. The C$^{2+}$ emission shell is located far out in the edge, outside of the reversal surface (at ~46cm -> $\rho/a = 0.9$) and it is extensively studied by T. Nishizawa during his drift wave work \cite{Nishizawa2018, Nishizawa2018b}. The C$^{2+}$ ions also have a higher mass-to-charge ratio, which, according to theories developed for sawtooth crash heating, should correlate to more significant heating and anisotropy\cite{Fiksel2009,Tangri}. However, direct comparisons between the two on this basis is difficult as the emission shells' radial location is different sufficiently that they reflect significantly different plasma conditions. The C$^{4+}$ emission shell is somewhat broader but located around the reversal surface. The measurements are performed simultaneously, and thus, each burst in the ensemble contributes information on both ~$T_{\perp}$ and ~$T_{\parallel}$. The (approximately) parallel observation is taken from the inboard side of the device to reduce any effects from the increased wall interaction during the burst, which primarily interacts with the outboard limiter. The results displayed in figure~\ref{fig:m0_anisotropy} show confusing contradiction. While both sets of measurements show anisotropy, the 'direction' of anisotropy is conflicting. The C$^{4+}$ measurement shows $\Delta T_{\parallel} > \Delta T_{\perp}$, but the C$^{2+}$ measurement shows $\Delta T_{\perp} > \Delta T_{\parallel}$. Additionally, the observed anisotropic heating associated with sawtooth events have the perpendicular direction being the strongly heated one, corresponding to expectations for possible heating mechanisms such as stochastic heating, or ion cyclotron damping. The strong parallel heating observed here with C$^{4+}$ does not have a ready-made heating mechanism associated. However, these anisotropy arguments should be taken with a grain of salt as described above, as well as the fact that the emission shell location may move dramatically over the course of the observation period as sharp movements in flux surface and particle flux is expected for the burst. It would be more ideal to observe anisotropy through active CHERS measurement, but currently the CHERS toroidal view is not able to measure the radial region of interest.

\section{Classical ion thermal model results of $m = 0$ bursts}\label{sec:m0_v_model}

It is interesting to examine the equilibrium ion transport model response to a $m = 0$ -like heating event, through it is importantly to note that the model does not produce a direct comparison to observations as the model produces the response to direct majority ion heating. The zeroth order approximation involves simulating the burst heating by increasing the the \textit{ad hoc} term described in section \ref{sec:anomalous_heating} for a short duration (0.1ms) that corresponds to the typical burst duration. The magnitude of this increase is matched to the observed peak temperature at $\rho/a = 0.75$, and the model predictions are shown in figure \ref{fig:m0_model}. The characteristic time of the return to equilibrium as predicted by the forward model is noticeably longer than observations, especially for the $\rho/a = 0.55$ measurement location. This is despite the effect of the burst-induced temperature profile causing more heat loss in the edge region, due to both charge exchange, and particle loss. This discrepancy between the model and observation indicts one of the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The assumption that, except for the ion heating, the plasma is otherwise not meaningfully disturbed by the $m = 0$ burst is incorrect. Thus, additional transport mechanisms are 'activated' during the burst, and persist long enough to dissipate a significant portion of the heating. From previous discussion, we know that $T_e$ is significantly impacted by bursts, and FIR interferometry show that the bursts often lead to a sudden density drop followed by recovery. These would likely impact the plasma in significant ways that is not accounted for by this simple model estimation.
    %It would be good to think of a couple examples in anticipation of questions during your oral defense.
    \item The heating of the majority ions are significantly smaller than that of the impurities, and the burst measurements does not reflect the majority temperature evolution. Assuming that $m = 0$ related impurity heating is through similar mechanisms to that present in sawtooth crashes, then it would be expected that the impurities experience more heating than the majority ions. If this is the case, the observed T$_{C^{6+}}$ fall off would be determined primarily by the equilibration time with the majority ion, which is calculated to be ~0.3-0.5ms near the reversal surface for these plasma conditions. The observed equilibration time matches this time scale, but without direct measurements of $T_{D^+}$ the hypothesis cannot be confirmed.
    \item The model is deficient in complex and difficult to characterize ways.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

It should be noted that the heating response produced is radially located to the same locations as observations without additional adjustments to the radial profile of the \textit{ad hoc} heating term. Considering the fact that the tearing mode activity is reduced and not eliminated, it is tempting to speculate that the \textit{ad hoc} heating needed by the model during the temperature share parallels in terms of mechanism to the heating seen during m = 0 bursts.
%The sentence above is an incomplete sentence. What are you speculating about the ad hoc heating term?

\section{Summary}

The impurity heating associated with $m = 0$ bursts are measured and investigated. Building upon prior understanding of $m = 0$ bursts, edge localized heating of carbon impurities are observed for $\rho/a \geq 0.55$. No signs of radial or toroidal propagation delay is observed at the time resolution available, indicating that the energy associated like traveled as waves and fluctuations and heats the relevant volume effectively simultaneously. Attempts to asses the anisotorpy of the heating is inconclusive, with the nature of emission shells and passive spectroscopy limiting our ability to interpret the measurements. Detailed modeling and understanding of plasma conditions and emission shell location shifts during a burst event may lead to better understanding of the passive measurements. A simple mock-up model calculation is constructed as a comparison. The model predicts that (if heated like impurities) the majority ions would retain the elevated temperature better than the measurement of carbon would indicate. This is likely due to a combination of over simplifying assumptions regarding background plasma conditions, and that majority ions behavior during a burst is likely different than that of the carbon impurities measured.
