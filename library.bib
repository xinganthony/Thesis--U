abstract = {By manipulating magnetic reconnection in Madison Symmetric Torus (MST) discharges, we have generated and confined for the first time a reversed-field pinch (RFP) plasma with an ion temperature {\textgreater}1 keV and an electron temperature of 2 keV. This is achieved at a toroidal plasma current of about 0.5 MA, approaching MST's present maximum. The manipulation begins with intensification of discrete magnetic reconnection events, causing the ion temperature to increase to several kiloelectronvolts. The reconnection is then quickly suppressed with inductive current profile control, leading to capture of a portion of the added ion heat with improved ion energy confinement. Electron energy confinement is simultaneously improved, leading to a rapid ohmically driven increase in the electron temperature. A steep electron temperature gradient emerges in the outer region of the plasma, with a local thermal diffusivity of about 2 m 2 s −1. The global energy confinement time reaches 12 ms, the largest value yet achieved in the RFP and which is roughly comparable to the H-mode scaling prediction for a tokamak with the same plasma current, density, heating power, size and shape.},

Measurements were taken in 2 ms long pulsed plasmas after the inductive helicity injectors were turned off. Attempts to measure neutrals during the main phase of the plasma were unsuccessful, likely due to the density of neutrals being below the detection threshold of the diagnostic. An unexpectedly low density of atomic deuterium was measured in the afterglow; roughly 100 times lower than the theoretical prediction of 1017 m-3. The neutral temperatures measured were on the order of 1 eV. Temporally and spatially resolved neutral density and temperature data are presented.},

The spatiotemporal shape of these structures is measured through extended toroidal and poloidal arrays of high-frequency magnetic probes at the plasma boundary. A simple model is used to interpret these structures as field-aligned current filaments, which are born at the reversal surface and propagate in the toroidal direction. The results found in MST share interesting commonalities with recent observations of filaments made during edge-localized modes in tokamaks and spherical tokamaks, as far as typical time scales, spatial localization and particle transport are concerned. Moreover, the dynamo effect produced by these events is estimated and compared with that produced during sawteeth. Though a single event has a small impact, the cumulative contribution of many of them produces a significant dynamo effect.},

A novel energy diagnostic is used to identify the path taken in Fourier space by the poloidal magnetic field energy as it is converted to axial magnetic field energy by the dynamo. At high values of the pinch parameter, $\Theta$, and Lundquist number, S, the dynamo can be alternatingly dominated by quasilinear and nonlinear processes in a quasiperiodic fashion. Quasilinearly, the m=1 modes can reverse the axial field by themselves. However, m=0 modes are crucial to produce the nonlinear dynamo that triggers quasiperiodic relaxations. The same causal mechanism is likely to be responsible for the experimentally observed sawteeth.},

The observed Balmer-$\beta$ light emission data from 17 shots during the 2010 NSTX campaign display no obvious trends with discharge parameters such as the divertor Balmer-$\alpha$ emission level or edge deuterium ion density. Simulations of 12 time slices in 7 of these discharges produce molecular densities near the vacuum vessel wall of 2-8×10 {\textless} sup {\textgreater} 17 {\textless} /sup {\textgreater} m {\textless} sup {\textgreater} -3 {\textless} /sup {\textgreater}  and atomic densities ranging from 1 to 7×10 {\textless} sup {\textgreater} 16 {\textless} /sup {\textgreater} m {\textless} sup {\textgreater} -3 {\textless} /sup {\textgreater} ; neither has a clear correlation with other parameters. Validation of the technique, begun in an earlier publication, is continued with an assessment of the sensitivity of the simulated camera image and neutral densities to uncertainties in the data input to the model. The simulated camera image is sensitive to the plasma profiles and virtually nothing else. The neutral densities at the vessel wall depend most strongly on the spatial distribution of the source; simulations with a localized neutral source yield densities within a factor of two of the baseline, uniform source, case. The uncertainties in the neutral densities associated with other model inputs and assumptions are≤50{\%}.},

abstract = {New profile measurements have allowed the electron thermal diffusivity profile to be estimated from power balance in the Madison Symmetric Torus where magnetic islands overlap and field lines are stochastic. The measurements show that (1) the electron energy transport is conductive not convective, (2) the measured thermal diffusivities are in good agreement with numerical simulations of stochastic transport, and (3) transport is greatly reduced near the reversal surface where magnetic diffusion is small. Toroidal plasma confinement systems rely upon symmetry for formation of nested magnetic flux surfaces. When flux surfaces exist, magnetic field lines and hence particle orbits are constrained to lie on a toroidal surface. Resonant, symmetry-breaking magnetic perturbations such as those generated from magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities can change the magnetic topology. If these fields are small, the magnetic field lines break into chains of magnetic islands at mode-rational surfaces where the perturbations are resonant [1,2]. When two or more nearby magnetic islands grow to the point where they overlap, the flux surfaces in between can be completely destroyed. In this case field lines are no longer constrained to a toroidal surface, but can wander stochastically [3,4]. The breakup of magnetic surfaces is predicted to have a dramatic effect on energy confinement. The free streaming orbits of particles parallel to the magnetic field result in a radial excursion of the particle's trajectory, leading to radial energy diffusion. The thermal conductivity is often assumed to be given by  v ll D M ; (1) where is the radial thermal conductivity, v ll is the velocity along the magnetic field, and D M is the magnetic field diffusivity.

Toroidal plasmas operating with strong magnetic relaxation and reconnection, as can occur in the reversed-field pinch (RFP) and spheromak configurations, are believed to have a stochastic magnetic field as a consequence of magnetic fluctuations associated with relaxation. The magnetic fluctuations in the RFP are a broad spectrum of internally resonant tearing modes driven by gradients in the current density profile. The RFP configuration is expected to be a good test bed for studying magnetic fluctuation induced transport since the overlapping magnetic tearing mode islands create a large radial region in which the magnetic flux surfaces are destroyed and field lines wander stochastically [6]. Recent efforts to control the current profile (magnetic stability free energy) lead to reduced stochasticity and greatly improved confinement in the RFP [7]. In this Letter, the coefficients of electron particle and heat transport have been determined from power balance analysis across the profile of the Madison Symmetric Torus (MST) reversed-field pinch [8] and are compared to theoretical predictions of transport in a stochastic magnetic field.

abstract = {The propagation and absorption of Alfv{\'{e}}n waves at $\omega$≈$\omega$ci is studied in a straight nonuniform helical plasma with elliptical cross section, placed in an inhomogeneous l = 2 magnetic field created by helical windings. The model antenna with a spectrum of kz induces the m = + 1 poloidal harmonic. In a uniform plasma in a uniform magnetic field the antenna excites the m = + 1 fast wave fields. These fields are right-handed almost everywhere in the plasma and they are not absorbed by plasma ions, hi the nonuniform helical l = 2 magnetic field under certain conditions the antenna excites mostly the m = + 1 fast wave and left-handed m = - 1 slow wave fields. The coupling between these waves in the nonunifonn magnetic field leads to the excitation of the left-handed wave field component near the plasma center and to the heating of plasma ions by this wave component. Collisionless absorption by plasma ions is assumed. The power deposition distribution in the plasma is examined for different plasma parameters. Results demonstrate that effective heating of the central part of the plasma at $\omega$ = $\omega$ci is possible for the low density plasmas in small scale devices. Because of the restrictions in the model, no firm conclusions can be made about the effectiveness of this method for high density plasmas in large scale devices. {\textcopyright} 2000 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {An auxiliary poloidal inductive electric field applied to a reversed-field pinch (RFP) plasma reduces the current density gradient, slows the growth of m= 1 tearing fluctuations, suppresses their associated sawteeth, and doubles the energy confinement time. This experiment attacks the dominant RFP plasma loss mechanism of parallel streaming in a stochastic magnetic field. The auxiliary electric field flattens the current profile and reduces the magnetic fluctuation level. Since a toroidal flux change linking the plasma is required to generate the inductive poloidal electric field, the current drive is transient to avoid excessive perturbation of the equilibrium. To sustain and enhance the improved state, noninductive current drivers are being developed. A novel electrostatic current drive scheme uses a plasma source for electron injection, and the lower-hybrid wave is a good candidate for radio-frequency current drive.},

abstract = {The current profile and core magnetic field fluctuation amplitudes in a reversed-field pinch are measured by using a high-resolution polarimetry-interferometry system. This paper presents data showing a redistribution of the current during a sawtooth crash. Also, the core magnetic field fluctuation amplitude is observed to increase at a sawtooth crash consistent with the idea of nonlinearly driven dynamo current. In addition, the parallel current density increases in the outer region of the plasma during auxiliary pulsed parallel current drive. This was expected, as the external application of an edge parallel electric field is designed to flatten the current profile providing an equilibrium closer to the minimum energy Taylor state. However, the current density also increases in the core, relative to standard plasmas. This increase can be explained by a reduction of the dynamo (anti)current drive in the core that should accompany the measured reduction of magnetic fluctuations and by a drop in resistivity caused by the increased confinement of fast electrons.

abstract = {Prolonged endoplasmic reticulum and osmotic stress synergistically activate the stress-induced N-rich protein-mediated signaling that transduces a cell death signal by inducing GmNAC81 (GmNAC6) in soybean. To identify novel regulators of the stress-induced programmed cell death (PCD) response, we screened a two-hybrid library for partners of GmNAC81. We discovered another member of the NAC (NAM-ATAF1,2-CUC2) family, GmNAC30, which binds to GmNAC81 in the nucleus of plant cells to coordinately regulate common target promoters that harbor the core cis-regulatory element TGTG[TGC]. We found that GmNAC81 and GmNAC30 can function either as transcriptional repressors or activators and cooperate to enhance the transcriptional regulation of common target promoters, suggesting that heterodimerization may be required for the full regulation of gene expression. Accordingly, GmNAC81 and GmNAC30 display overlapping expression profiles in response to multiple environmental and developmental stimuli. Consistent with a role in PCD, GmNAC81 and GmNAC30 bind in vivo to and transactivate hydrolytic enzyme promoters in soybean protoplasts. A GmNAC81/GmNAC30 binding site is located in the promoter of the caspase-1-like vacuolar processing enzyme (VPE) gene, which is involved in PCD in plants. We demonstrated that the expression of GmNAC81 and GmNAC30 fully transactivates the VPE gene in soybean protoplasts and that this transactivation was associated with an increase in caspase-1-like activity. Collectively, our results indicate that the stress-induced GmNAC30 cooperates with GmNAC81 to activate PCD through the induction of the cell death executioner VPE.},

A leapfrog algorithm is used to advance wave-like terms; advective terms are treated with a simple predictor-corrector method. The semi-implicit term is introduced as a simple modification to the momentum equation. Dissipation is treated implicitly. The resulting algorithm is unconditionally stable with respect to normal modes. A general discussion of the semi-implicit method is given, and specific forms of the semi-implicit operator are compared in physically relevant test cases.

The CHERS diagnosticmeasures impurity ion flow and temperature, localized to 2 cm with high time resolution ( ∼ 100 kHz ) . A spectral MSE diagnostic has been in use for five years, measuring ∣ B ∣ down to 0.2 T with high precision ( ∼ 2 {\%} ) and good time resolution ( 10 kHz ) . The Rutherford scatteringdiagnostic has demonstrated the robustness of this technique for reliable measurement of majority (D) ion temperature, also with high time resolution. MST is a large RFP ( R = 1.5 m , a = 0.52 m ) operated at moderate current ( I p ⩽ 600 kA ) , with n e typically ( 1 – 2 ) × 10 19 m − 3 and T e , T i ⩽ 2 keV . Two compact and reliable diagnostic neutral beams are installed on MST. These beams are short pulse, intense, monoenergetic, and low divergence. The first, a neutral H beam, is used in combination with ultraviolet and visible spectroscopy to make the CHERS and MSE measurements. For CHERS, the C VI line at 343.4 nm is collected by a custom high-throughput double grating spectrometer which simultaneously records both charge-exchange and background emissions. The spectrum is analyzed using a sophisticated model derived from the Atomic Database and Analysis Structure (ADAS) package. The MSE system records the entire H $\alpha$ Stark spectrum; ∣ B ∣ is derived from the measured splitting of the $\pi$ + and $\pi$ − manifolds. Measurement of ∣ B ∣ is critical to accurate equilibrium reconstruction in the RFP. The second diagnosticbeam is a 20 keV neutral He beam and is used for the Rutherford scatteringmeasurements. A pair of neutral particle analyzers is used to record the energy spectrum of the small-angle Rutherford scattered He atoms.},

abstract = {Generation and sustainment of the reversed field pinch RFP magnetic configuration normally relies on dynamo activity. The externally applied electric field tends to drive the equilibrium away from the relaxed, minimum energy state which is roughly described by a flat normalized parallel current density profile and is at marginal stability to tearing modes. Correlated fluctuations of magnetic field and velocity create a dynamo electric field which broadens the parallel current density profile, supplying the necessary edge current drive. These pervasive magnetic fluctuations are also responsible for destruction of flux surfaces, relegating the standard RFP to a stochastic-magnetic transport-limited device. Application of a tailored electric field profile which matches the relaxed current density profile allows sustainment of the RFP configuration without dynamo-driven edge current. The method used to ascertain that a dynamo-free RFP plasma has been created is reported here in detail. Several confinement improvements during the accompanying periods of low magnetic fluctuations are observed. Namely, the magnetic fluctuation level is reduced to the point where stochastic-magnetic transport is no longer the dominant process in the core and nested flux surfaces are restored in the core of the dynamo-free RFP.},

abstract = {A recent study investigating the role of electron density fluctuations in particle transport has been conducted on the Madison Symmetric Torus reversed-field pinch. Four diagnostics enabled this experiment: a high-speed multichord far-infrared laser interferometer, a multichord H alpha array, a 64-position magnetic coil array, and a Doppler spectrometer that measured impurity ion flow fluctuations. Correlation analysis is used to elucidate the relationship among density, magnetic, and impurity ion flow fluctuations. We observe that the electron density fluctuations are highly coherent with the magnetic fluctuations resulting from core-resonant resistive tearing modes. Moreover, the fluctuation-induced particle transport, obtained from the correlation between electron density and flow fluctuations, indicates that the core-resonant tearing modes do not drive significant particle transport in the plasma edge. We will address these four primary diagnostics, details of the analysis techniques, and principal results from this study. (C) 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Robust and global phenomena associated with sawtooth crashes are studied in a reversed field pinch plasma. These phenomena are: current profile relaxation, plasma momentum profile relaxation, and anomalous ion heating. We have implemented new diagnostics to characterize these processes with good spatial and temporal resolution. The profile of the parallel current to the magnetic field (inferred via laser polarimetry) flattens after the sawtooth crash which provides the most complete evidence of plasma relaxation toward a Taylor state. At the sawtooth crash we observe transport and relaxation of both the toroidal and parallel plasma momentum. The flattening of the parallel momentum profile has been predicted by two-fluid MHD theory. The majority ion temperature is measured with the Rutherford scattering diagnostic and the minority ion temperature is measured with charge exchange recombination spectroscopy. At the sawtooth crash the ion temperature almost doubles and a significant fraction of the equilibrium magnetic field energy is transferred into the ion thermal energy.},

Sensitivities of the H(alpha) spectra to the pitch angles of injected neutral beams (NBs) and these to the angle between the sight line of the measurement and NB injection path are examined. The energy dependence of the charge exchange cross section significantly affects the observed spectra since the driving NB is injected perpendicular to the magnetic field lines in the geometry of LHD. The measured spectra are compared to the spectra of GNET simulation results and the simulated spectra agreed well with the experimental measurement when we take into account the contribution of halo neutrals. Although it is difficult to obtain the fast ion distribution functions directly, this technique provides useful experimental data in benchmarking simulation codes.},

Data have been collected from three types of impulsive reconnection event, in which the resistive tearing mode activity associated with reconnection is present either in the edge plasma, the core plasma, or throughout the plasma volume. A drop in the stored magnetic energy is required for ion heating to be observed during magnetic reconnection, and when this occurs, heating is concentrated in regions where reconnection is taking place. The magnitude of the observed temperature rise during reconnection varies with ion species, suggesting that the heating mechanism has a mass and/or charge dependence. Both the magnitude and spatial structure of the observed temperature rise also depend on the plasma current and density. Nonetheless, the fraction of released magnetic energy converted to ion thermal energy remains roughly constant over a range of plasma conditions.},

The distribution of laser power through the 11 chord system is managed with wire mesh beamsplitters. Concurrent with the system upgrade to polarimetry, a detailed study of the effect of the wire mesh beamsplitters on beam polarization was conducted. The study shows that the mesh characteristics must be included to extract the polarimetry phase measurement from the raw data.

During a sawtooth crash in the Madison Symmetric Torus RFP, the ion temperature can spontaneously double in ϳ100 ␮s. It is also observed that high Z impurities are heated more strongly than bulk ions. The possibility of ion heating due to tearing instabilities at sawtooth crash is examined. Heating scenarios due to viscous damping of strongly localized perpendicular and parallel flows driven in the vicinity of resonant surface in tearing mode are considered. Flow amplitudes and spatial scales are estimated from linear and nonlinear resistive magnetohydrodynamic modeling. The heating rates are found from kinetic models with different levels of approximation, up to solving kinetic equation with a Landau collision operator. Results show reasonable agreement of the modeled impurity heating rate with the experiment, while the estimated bulk ions heating is somewhat weaker than in the experiment. Further theoretical and experimental study are required for a more definite conclusion as to whether it is the main ion heating mechanism or if there is some other important ion heating scenario.},

Now, through refined poloidal electric field control, plus control of the toroidal electric field, it is possible to reduce simultaneously the m = 0 and m = 1 fluctuations. This has allowed confinement of high-energy runaway electrons, possibly indicative of flux-surface restoration in the usually stochastic plasma core. The electron temperature profile steepens in the outer region of the plasma, and the central electron temperature increases substantially, reaching nearly 1.3 keV at high toroidal plasma current (500 kA). At low current (200 kA), the total beta reaches 15{\%} with an estimated energy confinement time of 10 ms, a tenfold increase over the standard value which for the first time substantially exceeds the constant-beta confinement scaling that has characterized most reversed-field-pinch plasmas. {\textcopyright} 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

Neutral particle profiles in the shear layer are reconstructed primarily with the DEGAS code using plasma parameters obtained by fitting discharge data with the B2.5 code. A series of discharges in which the ion grad B drift direction is toward the X-point is analyzed. For reversed Bt, the L to H transition power threshold is 2-4 times higher than normal Btdischarges at the same density: one discharge of this type is analyzed. The variation of the L-H transition power threshold divided by the density is seen to be correlated with the neutral density scale length in the shear layer for both directions of the magnetic field. Radial and poloidal neutral particle profile results for three low density discharges in which the L-H transition power threshold varies from 1.3 to 5.3 MW are presented.},

The charge-to-mass separation allows for separate analysis of bulk deuterium ions and hydrogen ions injected with a 1 MW, 25 keV neutral beam. Orientation of the ANPA allows sampling of different regions of ion velocity space; a radial viewport favors collection of ions with high v(perpendicular)∕|v| while a recently installed tangential viewport favors ions with high v(||)∕|v|, such as those from the core-localized fast ion population created by the neutral beam. Signals are observed in the ANPA's highest energy channels during periodic magnetic reconnection events, which are drivers of anisotropic, non-Maxwellian ion energization in the reversed-field pinch. ANPA signal strength is dependent on the background neutral density, which also increases during magnetic reconnection events, so careful analysis must be performed to identify the true change in the ion distribution.

Charge exchange emissions are obtained between 528 and 530 nm with 1 $\mu$s time resolution to study plasma instabilities. A primary challenge of extracting fluctuation measurements from raw UF-CHERS signals is photon and electronic noise. In order to reduce dark current, the Avalanche Photodiode (APD) detectors are thermo-electrically cooled. State-of-the-art components are used for the signal amplifiers and conditioners to minimize electronic noise. Due to the low incident photon power (≤1 nW), APDs with a gain of up to 300 are used to optimize the signal to noise ratio. Maximizing the APDs' gain while minimizing the excess noise factor (ENF) is essential since the total noise of the diagnostic sets a floor for the minimum level of detectable broadband fluctuations. The APDs' gain should be high enough that photon noise dominates electronic noise, but not excessive so that the ENF overwhelms plasma fluctuations. A new generation of cooled APDs and optimized preamplifiers exhibits significantly enhanced signal-to-noise compared to a previous generation. Experiments at DIII-D have allowed for characterization and optimization of the ENF vs. gain. A gain of ∼100 at 1700 V is found to be near optimal for most plasma conditions. Ion temperature and toroidal velocity fluctuations due to the edge harmonic oscillation in quiescent H-mode plasmas are presented to demonstrate UF-CHERS' capabilities.},

abstract = {In the reversed field pinch ions are heated anomalously relative to collisional energy exchange with Ohmically heated electrons. The process channels electron energy to ions in a way that is still not understood. Recent observations suggest that impurities are preferentially heated. A theory for ion heating via impurity ion-cyclotron-resonant damping of the turbulent energy cascaded from unstable global tearing modes is presented. The theory treats the magnetic turbulence as an Alfv{\'{e}}n wave cascade and calculates the rate of damping to impurity ions via cyclotron resonances. The transient temperature rise in sawtooth crashes is modeled from a 0-D transport model that accounts for the resonant cyclotron heating, anomalous heat losses, and collisional equipartition between impurities, bulk ions, electrons, and parallel and perpendicular temperatures. The larger fluctuation level at lower impurity cyclotron frequencies and the multiplicity of impurity resonances lead to heating rates that are consistent with experiment. Dependencies on temperature, density, and magnetic fluctuation level are described. The magnetic fluctuation spectrum is modeled for dissipation associated with viscosity, resistivity and cyclotron resonances. When Visco-resistive dissipation range spectra derived for MHD turbulence are fit to the MST spectrum, the viscosity and resistivity inferred are much larger than the experimental values. Analysis of asymmetry in the toroidal wavenumber spectrum suggests that additional dissipation is coming from the cyclotron resonance with impurity ions.},

abstract = {Tokamak plasma transport equations are usually obtained by flux surface averaging the collisional Braginskii equations. However, tokamak plasmas are not in collisional regimes. Also, ad hoc terms are added for neoclassical effects on the parallel Ohm's law, fluctuation-induced transport, heating, current-drive and flow sources and sinks, small magnetic field nonaxisymmetries, magnetic field transients, etc. A set of self-consistent second order in gyroradius fluid-monent-based transport euqations for nearly axisymmetric tokamak plasmas have been developed using a kinetic-based approach. The derivation uses neoclassical-based parallel viscous force closures, and includes all the effects noted above. Plasma processes on successive time scales and constraints they impose are considered sequentially: compressional Alfven waves (Grad-Shafranov equilibrium, ion radial force balance), sound waves (pressure constant along field lines, incompressible flows within a flux surface), and collisions (electrons, parallel Ohm's law; ions, damping of poloidal flow). Radial particle fluxes are driven by the many second order in gyroradius toroidal angular torques on a plasma species: seven ambipolar collision-based ones (classical, neoclassical, etc.) and eight nonambipolar ones (flunctuation-induced, polarization flows from toroidal rotation transients, etc.). The plasma toroidal rotaion euqation results from setting to zero the net radial current induced by the nonambipolar fluxes. The radial particle flux consists of the collision-based intrinsically ambipolar fluxes plus the nonambipolar fluxes evaluated at the ambipolarity-enforcing toroidal plasma rotation (radial electric field). The energy transport equations do not involve an ambipolar constraint and hence are more directly obtained. The "mean field" effects of microturbulence on the parallel Ohm's law, poloidal ion flow, particle fluxes, and toroidal momentum and energy transport are all included self-consistently. The final comprehensive equations describe radial transport of plasma toroidal rotation, and poloidal and toroidal magnetic fluxes, as well as the usual particle and energy tranport.},

abstract = {The Thomson scattering diagnostic on MST records both equilibrium and fluctuating electron temper-ature with a range capability of 10 eV–5 keV. Standard operation with two modified commercial Nd:YAG lasers allows measurements at rates of 1 kHz–25 kHz. Several subsystems of the diagnostic are being improved. The power supplies for the avalanche photodiode detectors (APDs) that record the scattered light are being replaced to improve usability, reliability, and maintainability. Each of the 144 APDs will have an individual rack mounted switching supply, with bias voltage adjustable to match the APD. Long-wavelength filters (1140 nm center, 80 nm bandwidth) have been added to the polychromators to improve capability to resolve non-Maxwellian distributions and to enable directed electron flow measurements. A supercontinuum (SC) pulsed white light source has replaced the tungsten halogen lamp previously used for spectral calibration of the polychromators. The SC source combines substantial brightness produced in nanosecond pulses with a spectrum that covers the entire range of the polychromators. Published by AIP Publishing.

Magnetized plasmas relax when they seek their natural state of lowest energy subject to certain topological constraints imposed by the magnetic field. Relaxation may be fast and dynamic or slow and gradual depending on the external environment in which the magnetoplasma system evolves. Relaxation occurs throughout the universe and may describe such diverse phenomena as dynamos, solar flares, and the operation of magnetic fusion energy experiments. This book concentrates on the dynamic, rather than variational aspects of relaxation. While the processes described are general, the book focuses on the reversed-field pinch experiment as a paradigm for plasma relaxation and dynamo action. Examples from other branches of plasma physics are also discussed. The authors draw upon their extensive experience in numerical and experimental studies of relaxation.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Impurity transport from Coulomb collisions in the reversed-field pinch is classical for all collisionality regimes, and analysis shows that the observed hollow profile and outward convection can be explained by the classical temperature screening mechanism.

abstract = {Transient application of a poloidal electric field to reversed field pinch RFP plasmas has led to a period in which dynamo activity inherent in standard RFP plasmas nearly vanishes. Measurements of the plasma resistivity, current density and electric field profiles show the edge-applied electric field accommodates Ohm's law balance without a dynamo term over the entire cross section. Neoclassical theory accurately predicts the resistivity in the RFP, as the predicted resistivity profile based on measurements of electron temperature, effective ionic charge, and two-dimensional equilibrium effects is in agreement with the ratio of the parallel electric field and current density profiles. Conventional reversed field pinch RFP plasmas are formed via application of a toroidal electric field within a relatively weak toroidal magnetic field. 1 Internal redistribution of the current density leads to the well known equilibrium: a monotonically decreasing toroidal magnetic field profile which reverses direction at the extreme edge. 2,3 The dynamo process-the self-generation of current-is thus inherent in the RFP; 4-6 the applied electric field does not account for the current. This is most apparent outside the reversal layer where the applied electric field and current are antiparallel, as indicated in Fig. 1. In this standard RFP plasma, the magnetohydrodynamic MHD dynamo is responsible for driving the non-inductive current and the parallel Ohm's law E v ˜b˜J˜b˜˜b˜J is obeyed. 7 Here, E is the axisymmetric component of the applied electric field aligned with the magnetic field, J is the field-aligned current density, and the nonlinear interaction of resistive MHD modes creates coherent magnetic field (b ˜) and velocity (v ˜) fluctuations which form a net parallel emf (v ˜b˜)˜b˜˜b˜). Theoretical work 8 has indicated that externally driven poloidal current in the RFP can stabilize the plasma to the tearing mode activity. Indeed, it has been previously reported that fluctuations have been reduced by inductively driving edge current. 9,10 Magnetic fluctuation levels are reduced dramatically , thereby improving the electron energy confinement, 11 and measurements show a substantial drop in the v ˜b˜dynamo˜b˜˜b˜dynamo term in the plasma edge. 12 In this paper, we report the production of a RFP plasma in which the dynamo is essentially absent, E J over nearly the entire cross section. This result has implications on RFP performance: it is demonstrated that a fluctuation-driven dynamo and the accompanying confinement degradation is not required for existence of the high RFP configuration. The dynamo-free periods occur during pulsed poloidal current drive PPCD experiments in the Madison Symmetric Torus MST 13 RFP. The toroidal field windings are pulsed in a sense to remove toroidal flux from the machine and the inductive response of the plasma drives parallel poloidal current in the edge. The modification of the current profile stabilizes the plasma to the tearing modes, and the need for dynamo-driven poloidal current is removed. Typical discharges are shown in Fig. 2, where the magnetic fluctuation level, toroidal magnetic flux and boundary voltage temporal traces are plotted for both standard dashed line and PPCD solid line plasmas. The equilibrium in standard RFP plasmas contains a series of discrete dynamo events as first reported in Ref. 14 manifested by a step-like increase in toroidal flux accompanying bursts of correlated magnetic field and velocity fluctuations in the MST. In PPCD experiments solid line, 0.009 st0.017 s in Fig. 2, several distinct pulses capacitor discharges, see Fig. 2c are applied to remove toroidal flux from the machine, Fig. 2b. The periodic bursts of magnetic fluctuations Fig. 2a are replaced with a smooth period with a rms amplitude of less than 1{\%}. We show the dynamo has nearly vanished by independent measurements of the current density, electric field, and resistivity based on electron temperature and ionic charge profiles. The data below are accumulated by averaging several hundred similar discharges to compile adequate statistics in the Thomson scattering-measured electron temperature profile. The resistivity in a torus is modified from that originally given by Spitzer by the existence of trapped particles and non-Maxwellian fast particles; both of these factors can exist in the RFP. Routine MST diagnostics were used to measure the average profiles in Fig. 3 to determine the resistivity profile based on neoclassical theory in PPCD discharges. These deuterium discharges fill pressure of about 0.5 mTorr have plasma current of 400 kA and an outboard-limited, circular last closed flux surface. Shown are profiles of electron density Fig. 3a measured with an 11 chord FIR interfer-ometer and the electron temperature profile Fig. 3b. The effective ionic charge (Z eff) profile Fig. 3c is deduced from measurement of near-infrared bremsstrahlung; this is accessible only in the extended period of low magnetic fluctuation level. In standard plasmas, pollutant emission from neutral particles primarily sourced from wall recycling dominates the target radiation. In PPCD plasmas with a much lower neutral density the pollutant emission is about the same level as electron-ion bremsstrahlung, and is sepa},

abstract = {Noncollisional ion heating in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas and the mechanism of conversion of magnetic energy to ion thermal energy are not well understood. In the Madison Symmetric Torus reversed-field pinch experiment, ions are heated rapidly during impulsive reconnection, attaining temperatures exceeding hundreds of eV, often well in excess of the electron temperature. The energy budget of the ion heating and its mass scaling in hydrogen, deuterium, and helium plasmas were determined by measuring the fraction of the released magnetic energy converted to ion thermal energy. The fraction ranges from about 10{\%}-30{\%} and increases approximately as the square root of the ion mass. A simple model based on stochastic ion heating is proposed that is consistent with the experimental data.},

Emphasis is on the probable effect of a thin (resistive) shell design on experimental operation. Calculations are performed over a range of Lundquist number S and pinch parameter $\Theta$, with realistic geometric parameters. It is found that operation with a thin shell is likely to be characterized by an enhanced fluctuation level, increased loop voltage and generally degraded plasma performance. This conclusion is independent of the specific value of the design thin shell time constant as long as this value is significantly less than the design discharge time. Specific scalings of loop voltage with Lundquist and pinch parameter are given. Results relevant to toroidal phase locking are also reported},

abstract = {We have created a forward model for charge-exchange impurity density measurements that incorporates neutral beam attenuation measurements self-consistently for the purpose of determining the ion-effective charge Z eff . The model is constructed within an integrated data analysis framework to include a self-consistent calculation of neutral beam attenuation due to multiple impurity species into the measurement of a single impurity density. The model includes measurements of the beam Doppler-shift spectrum and shine-through particle flux to determine the neutral beam particle density which is attenuated by ion collisions. Synthetic data are generated from the diagnostic forward model using statistical and calibration uncertainties. These " noisy " data are used in the analysis to evaluate how accurately Z eff is determined. Methods of experimental design are employed to calculate the information gained from different diagnostic combinations. The analysis shows that while attenuation measurements alone do not provide a unique impurity density measurement in the case of a multispecies inhomogeneous plasma, they do provide an effective measurement of the Z eff profile and place constraints on the impurity density profiles.},

abstract = {Magnetic islands in the Madison Symmetric Torus (MST) reversed-field pinch (RFP) exhibit varying degrees of overlap, sometimes resulting in complex partially chaotic magnetic field regions. Although prior measurements of thermal confinement in highly chaotic magnetic field regions in MST showed good agreement with a stochastic transport model, the low-chaos case was not studied in detail. In this work, the high-repetition rate (25 kHz) Thomson scattering (TS) laser at MST probed electron temperatureTe fluctuations correlated with m= 1,n= 5−7 tearing modes, which rotate at 10 to 20 kHz. Bayesian statistical methods allow extraction of the modes'Testructures from large datasets. TheTe fluctuations of ad-jacent modes overlap significantly, suggesting that magnetic chaos exists. Nonetheless, the strong higher-harmonic content of then= 6modeTe fluctuations indicates confinement of Ohmic heating within the island leading to a localTe peak. A new, higher repetition-rate (66 - 333 kHz) TS laser developed at MST captured for the first time in an RFP a 2D picture of theTe structure of a magnetic island-shaped chaotic structure during a single discharge. This largen= 6structure exhibited peaked internalTe . Magnetic field modeling indicates that chaotic magnetic field lines fill most of the former island volume, due to overlap of then= 6island with the smaller neighboringn= 7,8 islands. Modeling of transport in the chaotic magnetic field yields an effective perpendicular electron thermal conductivity of $\chi$e,m≈30 m2/s, in good agreement with the inferred conductivity$\chi$e,th≈20 m2/s based on inferred Ohmic heating and the observedTe gradient inside the island. This demonstrates that magnetic structures with reduced chaos can exhibit sufficient confinement to develop appreciableTe peaking when Ohmically heated. A complimentary experiment probing tur-bulence in a magnetic island was conducted in the DIII-D tokamak. A largem= 2,n = 1 magnetic island was induced by an external control coil. The beam emission spectroscopy di-agnostic provided a 2D map of long-wavelength electron density fluctuations as control coils rotated the island past the diagnostic. Preliminary analysis shows, as expected, strong tur-bulence suppression inside the island O-point and enhancement near the X-point, comparedto the turbulence in the absence of an island.},

We find that (1) energetic ions (produced by neutral beam injection) are very well-confined in the standard RFP plasma despite the presence of significant stochasticity. This is understood from theory and simulation, and has positive implications for feasibility of neutral beam injection and alpha-particle confinement; (2) when magnetic stochasticity is reduced the thermal ion confinement is substantially improved as well. This is evidenced from estimation of ion thermal diffusivity as well as from direct observations of long lasting periods of sustained high ion temperature.},
