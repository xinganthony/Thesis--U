\chapter{Conclusions and remarks}

Kithceneett and feed your and you are going to fight you.

\section{Summary of conclusions}

Transport is classical in the core, but significant amount of anomalous heating is present in the edge around the reversal surface. M = 0 bursts is associated with ion cyclotron heating though. Local reconnection -> toroidally global heating. Probably relevant in astro context where no reconnection is truly global. 

\section{Future work}

Rutherford scattering measurements of D+ temperature. 
Direct measurements of neutral temperature.
